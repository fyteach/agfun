## Properties of Equations

An ***equation*** is an statement that asserts an equality containing unknown variables. For example, $2x+3=1$ is an equation of the unknown variable $x$.  
Equations often contain variables other than the unknowns. Those variables, which are assumed to be known, are usually called ***constants***, ***coefficients*** or ***parameters***. For example, in the linear equation $ax+b=c$ of (the unknown) $x$, the variables $a$, $b$ and $c$ are referred as known coefficients or constants.  
An ***identity*** is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variable(s) it contains. For example, $x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)$ is an identity.  
***Solving an equation*** consists of determining values of the variables that make the equality true. Two equations are said to be ***equivalent*** if and only if they have the same solution set, that is, a solution of one equation is also a solution of the other equation. For example $2x-6=0$ and $x-1=2$ are equivalent.

::: {.rmdnote}

When solving an equation, the following operations can be used to transform an equation to an equivalent one:

- Adding or subtracting the same quantity to both sides of an equation. For example, $x-1=2$ is equivalent to $x-1+1=2+1$.
- Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation **by a non-zero quantity**. For example $2x=4$ is equivalent to $\frac{2x}{2}=\frac{4}{2}$.
- Applying an identity to transform one side of the equation. For example, $x^2-1=0$ is equivalent to $(x-1)(x+1)=0$, where the identity $x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)$ was applied.

In general, one may apply any choice of a function to both sides of the equation to make a transformation. The resulting equation still has the solutions of the original equations as it solutions. However, the resulting equation may also have some extra solutions which are called ***extraneous solutions***. For example, taking squares of both sides of the equation $x=1$ produces the equation $x^2=1$. The new equation $x^2=1$ has two solutions $x=-1$ and $x=1$, but the original equation $x=1$ only has one solution. The solution $x=-1$ of the equation $x^2=1$ is an extraneous solution of the equation $x=1$.

## Quadratic Equations

A **polynomial equation** is an equation that can be written in the form
$$
a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}=0,
$$
where $n$ is a positive integer and $a_n\ne 0$.

A polynomial equation is called a ***quadratic equation*** if $n=2$. For example, $2x^2+5x-3=0$. We often write a quadratic equation in its ***standard form***
$$a x^2+bx+c=0,$$
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are numbers, and $a\neq 0$.

When solving linear equations, arithmetic operations are enough. In general, one may need to use identity or functional operation. Factoring is one of those frequently used identity operation. Indeed, to solve a problem, a general strategy is to to reduce the original problem to easier problems. Using factoring and the ***zero product property***:
$$A\cdot B=0 \quad ~~\text{if and only if}~~  \quad A=0 ~~\text{or}~~ B=0,$$
one can transform a polynomial equation into smaller degree polynomial equations. In particular, if $ax^2+bx+c=(mx-p)(nx-q)$, then a solution of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is a solution of either $mx-p=0$ or $nx-q=0$.

:::

:::{.solution}
\

1. Suppose that the width of the frame is $x$ meters. Translate given information into expressions in $x$ and build an equation.\
Total Width: $2x+10$ \ Total Length: $2x+16$\
Width $\times$ Length=Total Area:
$$(2x+10)(2x+16)=216.$$
1. Solve the equation.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        (2x+10)(2x+16)&=216\\
        4x^2+52x+160&=216\\
        4x^2+52x-56&=0\\
        x^2+13x-14&=0\\
        (x+14)(x-1)&=0
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    $$
    x = -14\quad \text{or}\quad x = 1
    $$
1. So the width of the path is $1$ meter.
