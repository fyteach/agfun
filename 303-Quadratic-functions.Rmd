# Quadratic Functions

## Maximize the Revenue

::: {.rmdthink}

When price increases, demand decreases and vice verse. A retail store found that the price $p$ as a function of the demand $x$ for a certain product is $p(x)=100-\frac12 x$. The revenue $R$ of selling $x$ units is $R=x\cdot p(x)=x(100-\frac12x)$. To maximize the revenue, what should be the price?

## The Graph of a Quadratic Function

The graph of a quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, $a\neq 0$, is called a ***parabola***.

By completing the square, a quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ can always be written in the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $h=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$ and $k=f(h)=f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)$.

1. The line $x=h=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$ is called the ***axis of symmetry*** of the parabola.
2. The point $(h, k)=\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}, f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)\right)$ is called the ***vertex*** of the parabola.

## The Minimum or Maximum of a Quadratic Function

Consider the quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, $a\neq 0$.

1. If $a>0$, then the parabola opens upward and $f$ has a minimum  $f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)$ at the vertex.
1. If $a<0$, then the parabola opens downward and $f$ has a maximum  $f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)$ at the vertex.

## Intercepts of a Quadratic Function

Consider the quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, $a\neq 0$.

1. The $y$-intercept is $(0, f(0))=(0, c)$.
1. The $x$-intercepts, if exist, are the solutions of the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$.

:::{example}

Find the axis of symmetry and the vertex of the quadratic function $f(x)=x^2-4x+5$.

:::

:::{solution}

1. The coefficients are $a=1$, $b=-4$ and $c=5$.
   Then the axis of symmetry is
   $$x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{-4}{2\cdot 1}=2.$$

2. The vertex is given by 
   $$(-\frac{b}{2a}, f(-\frac{b}{2a}))=(2, f(2))=(2, 1).$$

:::

:::{example}

Find the axis of symmetry and the vertex of the quadratic function $f(x)=2(x-1)^2-1$.

:::

:::{solution}

1. The equation is in the perfect square form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$. In this case, $h=1$ and $k=-1$.
   Then the axis of symmetry is
   $$x=h=1.$$

2. The vertex is given by
   $$(h, k)=(1, -1).$$

:::{example}

Sketch the graph of the quadratic function $f(x)=x^2-2x+3$.

:::

:::{solution}

1. The line of symmetry is
   $$x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{-2}{2\cdot 1}=1.$$

2. The vertex is
   $$(-\frac{b}{2a}, f(-\frac{b}{2a}))=(1, f(1))=(1, 2).$$

3. Since $k=f(1)>0$ and $a=1>0$, the parabola is above the $x$-axis and there is no $x$-intercept.

4. The $y$-intercept is
   $$(0, f(0))=(0, c)=(0, 3).$$

5. To have a better graph, find an additional point on it, say
   $$(2, f(2))=(2, 3).$$

6. Using the above information to sketch the graph.

:::{example}

Does the function $f(x)=2x^2-4x-6$ have a maximum or minimum? Find it.

:::

:::{solution}
\

1. Since $a>2$, the function opens upward and has a minimum.
1. Find the line of symmetry $x=\frac{-b}{2a}$:
    $x=\frac{-(-4)}{2\cdot 2}=1$.
1. Find the minimum by plugging $x=1$ into the function $f$.
    The minimum is
    $$
    f(-\frac{b}{2a})=f(1)=2-4-6=-8.
    $$

:::

:::{example}

Consider the function $f(x)=-x^2+3x+6$. Find values of $x$ such that $f(x)=2$.

:::

:::{solution}
\

1. Set up the equation for $x$.
    \[-x^2+3x+6=2\]
1. Solve the equation $-x^2+3x+6=2$, we get $x=-1$ or $x=4$.
The values of $x$ such that $f(x)=2$ are $x=-1$ and $x=44$.

:::{example}

A quadratic function $f$ whose the vertex is $(1, 2)$ has a $y$-intercept $(0, -3)$. Find the equation that defines the function.

:::

:::{solution}
\

1. Write down the general form of $f$ using only the vertex.
    Quadratic functions with the vertex at $(1,2)$ are defined by $y=a(x-1)^2+2$, where $a$ is a nonzero real number.
1. Determine the unknown $a$ using the remaining information.
   Since $(0, -3)$ is on the graph of the function, the number $a$ must satisfy the equation  $-3=a(0-1)^2+2$.
2. Solving for $a$ from the equation, we get $a=-5$.
    The quadratic function $f$ is given by $f(x)=-5(x-1)^2+2$.
