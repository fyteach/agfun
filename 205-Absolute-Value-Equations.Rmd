## The Direction of a Number

Can you determine the value of the expression $\dfrac{|x|}{x}$ for all nonzero real number $x$ and explain the meaning of the value?

## Properties of Absolute Values

The ***absolute value*** of a real number $a$, denoted by $|a|$, is the distance from $0$ to $a$ on the number line. In particular, $|a|$ is always greater than or equal to $0$, that is $|a|\geq 0$. Absolute values satisfy the following properties:
$$
|-a|=|a|, \quad |ab|=|a||b| \quad \text{and} \quad \left|\frac{a}{b}\right|=\frac{|a|}{|b|}.
$$

\paragraph*{Absolute Value Equation} An absolute value equation may be rewritten as $|X|=c$, where $X$ represents an algebraic expression.

If $c$ is **positive**, then the equation $|X|=c$ is equivalent to {$X=c$\quad or \quad $X=-c$.}

If $c$ is **negative**, then the solution set of $|X|=c$ is **empty**.
An ***empty set*** is denoted by $\emptyset$.

More generally, $|X|=|Y|$ is equivalent to $X=Y$ or $X=-Y$.

The equation $|X|=0$ is equivalent to $X=0$.

Solve the equation
$$|2x-3|=7.$$

:::

:::{solution}
\

The equation is equivalent to
$$
\begin{aligned}
    2x-3  =-7   & \qquad\text{or} & 2x-3  =7  \\
    2x    =-4   &          & 2x    =10 \\
    x     =-2   & \qquad\text{or} & x     =5
\end{aligned}
$$

The solutions are $x=-2$ or $x=5$. In set-builder notation, the solution set is $\{-2, 5\}$.

:::{example}

Solve the equation
$$|2x-1|-3=8.$$

:::

:::{solution}
\

1. Rewrite the equation into $|X|=c$ form.
    $$|2x-1|=11$$

1. Solve the equation.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        2x-1  =-11   & \qquad\text{or} & 2x-1  =11 \\
        2x    =-10   &          & 2x    =12 \\
        x     =-5    & \qquad\text{or} & x     =6
    \end{aligned}
    $$

The solutions are $x=-5$ or $x=6$. In set-builder notation, the solution set is $\{-5, 6\}$.

:::{example}

Solve the equation
$$3|2x-5|=9.$$

:::

:::{solution}
\

1. Rewrite the equation into $|X|=c$ form.
    $$|2x-5|=3$$

2. Solve the equation.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        2x-5  =-3   & \qquad\text{or} & 2x-5  =3 \\
        2x    =2    &          & 2x    =8 \\
        x     =1    & \qquad\text{or} & x     =4
    \end{aligned}
    $$

The solutions are $x=1$ or $x=4$. In set-builder notation, the solution set is $\{1, 4\}$.

:::{example}

Solve the equation
$$2|1-2x|-3=7.$$

:::

:::{solution}
\

1. Rewrite the equation into $|X|=c$ form.
    $$|2x-1|=5$$

2. Solve the equation.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        2x-1  =-5   & \qquad\text{ or } & 2x-1  =5 \\
        2x    =-4   &            & 2x    =6 \\
        x     =-2   & \qquad\text{or}   & x     =3
    \end{aligned}
    $$

The solutions are $x=-2$ or $x=3$. In set-builder notation, the solution set is $\{-2, 3\}$.

:::

:::{example}

Solve the equation
$$|3x-2|=|x+2|.$$

:::

:::{solution}
\

Note that two numbers have the same absolute value only if they are the same or opposite to each other. Then the equation is equivalent to  
$$3x-2=x+2\quad \text{or} \quad 3x-2=-(x+2).$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
    3x-2  =x+2   & \qquad\text{or} & 3x-2  =-(x+2) \\
    2x    =4     &          & 4x    =0      \\
    x     =2     & \qquad\text{or} & x     =0
\end{aligned}
$$

The solutions are $x=2$ and $x=0$. In set-builder notation, the solution set is $\{0, 2\}$.

:::

:::{example}

Solve the equation
$$2|1-x|=|2x+10|.$$

:::

:::{solution}
\

Since $2$ is positive, $2|1-x|=|2||1-x|=|2-2x|$. Moreover, because $|-X|=|X|$, the equation is equivalent to
$$|2x-2|=|2x+10|.$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
    2x-2  =2x+10   & \qquad\text{or} & 2x-2  =-(2x+10) \\
    -2    =10      & \qquad\text{or} & 4x    =-8       \\
                   &          & x     =-2
\end{aligned}
$$

The original equation only has one solution $x=-2$. In set-builder notation, the solution set is $\{-2\}$.
