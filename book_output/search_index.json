With $12, would you like to order one 12-inches and two 8-inches. Why? A sheet of everyday copy paper is about 0.01 millimeter thick. Repeat folding along a different side 20 times. Now, how thick do you think the folded paper is? 1.2 Properties of Exponents For an integer \\(n\\), and an expression \\(x\\), the mathematical operation of the \\(n\\)-times repeated multiplication of \\(x\\) is call exponentiation, written as \\(x^n\\), that is, \\[ x^n=\\underbrace{x\\cdot x \\cdots x}_{n~\\text{factors of}~x}. \\] In the notation \\(x^n\\), \\(n\\) is called the exponent, \\(x\\) is called the base, and \\(x^n\\) is called the power, read as \\(x\\) raised to the \\(n\\)-th power, \\(x\\) to the \\(n\\)-th power, \\(x\\) to the \\(n\\)-th, \\(x\\) to the power of \\(n\\) or \\(x\\) to the \\(n\\). Property Example The product rule \\[x^m\\cdot x^n=x^{m+n}.\\] \\[2x^2\\cdot (-3x^3)=-6x^5.\\] The quotient rule (for \\(x\\neq 0\\).) \\[\\dfrac{x^m}{x^n}= \\begin{cases} x^{m-n} &amp; \\text{if} m\\ge n.\\\\[1em] \\dfrac{1}{x^{n-m}} &amp; \\text{if} m\\le n. \\end{cases} \\] \\[\\frac{15x^5}{5x^2}=3x^3;\\] \\[\\frac{-3x^2}{6x^3}=-\\frac{1}{2x}.\\] The zero exponent rule (for \\(x\\neq 0\\).) \\[x^0=1.\\] \\[(-2)^0=1;\\] \\[-x^0=-1.\\] The negative exponent rule (for \\(x\\neq 0\\).) \\[x^{-n}=\\dfrac{1}{x^n} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\dfrac{1}{x^{-n}}=x^n.\\] \\[(-2)^{-3}=\\frac{1}{(-2)^3}=-\\frac18;\\] \\[\\frac{x^{-2}}{x^{-3}}=\\frac{x^3}{x^2}=x.\\] The power to a power rule \\[\\left(x^a\\right)^b=x^{ab}.\\] \\[\\left(2^{2}\\right)^3=2^6=64;\\] \\[\\left(x^2\\right)^3=x^6.\\] The product raised to a power rule \\[(xy)^n=x^ny^n.\\] \\[\\left(-2x\\right)^{2}=(-2)^2x^2=4x^2.\\] The quotient raised to a power rule (for \\(y\\neq 0\\).) \\[\\left(\\dfrac{x}{y}\\right)^n=\\dfrac{x^n}{y^n}.\\] \\[ \\left(\\dfrac{x}{-2}\\right)^{3}=\\dfrac{x^3}{(-2)^3}=-\\dfrac{x^3}{8}.\\] Order of Basic Mathematical Operations In mathematics, the order of operations reflects conventions about which procedure should be performed first. There are four levels (from the highest to the lowest): Parenthesis; Exponentiation; Multiplication and Division; Addition and Subtraction. Within the same level, the convention is to perform from the left to the right. Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\[ \\left(\\dfrac{2y^{-2}z^{-5}}{4x^{-3}y^6}\\right)^{-4}. \\] The idea is to simplify the base first and rewrite using positive exponents only. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(\\dfrac{2y^{-2}z^{-5}}{4x^{-3}y^6}\\right)^{-4} =&amp;\\left(\\dfrac{x^3}{2z^{5}y^8}\\right)^{-4}\\\\ =&amp;\\left(\\dfrac{2z^{5}y^8}{x^3}\\right)^4\\\\ =&amp;\\dfrac{2^4(z^{5})^4(y^8)^4}{(x^3)^4}\\\\ =&amp;\\dfrac{16y^{32}z^{20}}{x^{12}}.\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Simplify (at least partially) the problem first To avoid mistakes when working with negative exponents, its better to apply the negative exponent rule to change negative exponents to positive exponents and simplify the base first. 1.3 Practice Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\((3a^2b^3c^2)(4abc^2)(2b^2c^3)\\) \\(\\dfrac{4y^3z^0}{x^2y^2}\\) \\((-2)^{-3}\\) Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\(\\dfrac{-u^0v^{15}}{v^{16}}\\) \\((-2a^3b^2c^0)^3\\) \\(\\dfrac{m^5 n^{2}}{(mn)^3}\\) Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\((-3a^2x^3)^{-2}\\) \\(\\left(\\dfrac{-x^0y^3}{2wz^2}\\right)^3\\) \\(\\dfrac{3^{-2}a^{-3}b^5}{x^{-3}y^{-4}}\\) Simplify.

Find the value of the polynomial \\(2x^3-98x\\) when \\(x=-7\\). Find the value of the polynomial \\(x^2-9x-22\\) when \\(x=11\\). Find the value of the polynomial \\(x^3-2x^2-9x+18\\) when \\(x=-3\\). Find the value of \\(16^2-14^2\\). 2.2 Factor by Removing the GCF The greatest common factor (GCF) of two terms is a polynomial with the greatest coefficient and of the highest possible degree that divides each term. To factor a polynomial is to express the polynomial as a product of polynomials of lower degrees. The first and the easiest step is to factor out the GCF of all terms. Factor \\(4x^3y-8x^2y^2+12x^3y^3\\).   Find the GCF of all terms. The GCF of \\(4x^3y\\), \\(-8x^2y^2\\) and \\(12x^4y^3\\) is \\(4x^2y\\). Write each term as the product of the GCF and the remaining factor. \\(4x^3y=(4x^2y)\\cdot x\\), \\(-8x^2y^2=(4x^2y)\\cdot (-2y)\\), and \\(12x^4y^3=(4x^2y)(3xy^2)\\). Factor out the GCF from each term. \\(4x^3y-8x^2y^2+12x^3y^3=4x^2y\\cdot(x-2y+3xy^2)\\). 2.3 Factor by Grouping For a four-term polynomial, in general, we will group them into two groups and factor out the GCF for each group and then factor further. Factor \\(2x^2-6xy+xz-3yz\\).   For a polynomial with four terms, one can normally try the grouping method. Group the first two terms and the last two terms. \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;2x^2-6xy+xz-3yz\\\\ =&amp;(2x^2-6xy)+(xz-3yz) \\end{aligned} \\] Factor out the GCF from each group. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;2x(x-3y)+z(x-3y) \\end{aligned} \\] Factor out the binomial GCF. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;(x-3y)(2x+z). \\end{aligned} \\] Factor \\(ax+4b-2a-2bx\\). Group the first term with the third term and group the second term with the last term. \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;ax+4b-2a-2bx\\\\ =&amp;(ax-2a)+(-2bx+4b) \\end{aligned} \\] Factor out the GCF from each group. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;a(x-2)+(-2b)(x-2) \\end{aligned} \\] Factor out the binomial GCF. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;(x-2)(a-2b). \\end{aligned} \\] Guess and check. Once you factored one group, you may expect that the other group has the same binomial factor so that factoring may be continued. 2.4 Factor Difference of Powers Factoring is closely related to solving polynomial equations. If a polynomial equation \\(p(x)=0\\) has a solution \\(r\\), then \\(p(x)\\) has a factor \\(x-r\\). For example, \\(x^n-r^n=0\\) has a solution \\(x=r\\). So the difference \\(x^n-r^n\\) has a factor \\((x-r)\\). Using long division or by induction, we obtain the following equality. Difference of \\(n\\)-th powers \\[a^n-b^n=(a-b)(a^{n-1}+a^{n-2}b+\\cdots +ab^{n-2}+b^{n-1})\\] In particular, \\[a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b).\\] Factor \\(25x^2-16\\). Recognize the binomial as a difference of squares. \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;25x^2-16\\\\ =&amp;(5x)^2-4^2 \\end{aligned} \\] Apply the formula. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;(5x-4)(5x+4). \\end{aligned} \\] Factor \\(32x^3y-2xy^5\\) completely. \\[ \\begin{aligned} 32x^3y-2xy^3 =&amp;2xy(16x^2-y^4)\\\\ =&amp;2xy((4x)^2-(y^2)^2)\\\\ =&amp;2xy(4x+y^2)(4x-y^2). \\end{aligned} \\] 2.5 Factor Trinomials If a trinomial \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), \\(A\\neq 0\\), can be factored, then it can be expressed as a product of two binomials: \\[ax^2+bx+c=(mx+n)(px+q).\\] By simplify the product using the FOIL method and comparing coefficients, we observe that \\[ a=\\underbrace{mn}_{\\mathrm{F}}\\quad\\quad\\quad b=\\underbrace{mq}_{\\mathrm{O}}~\\underset{+}{\\underset{}{+}}~\\underbrace{np}_{\\mathrm{I}} \\quad\\quad\\quad c=\\underbrace{nq}_{\\mathrm{F}} \\] A trinomial \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) is also called a quadratic polynomial. The function defined by \\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\\) is called a quadratic function. Trial and error. The observation suggests to use trial and error to find the undetermined coefficients \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\) from factors of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) such that the sum of cross products \\(mq+np\\) is \\(b\\). A diagram as shown in the following examples will be helpful to check a trial. Factor \\(x^2+6x+8\\). :::{solution} One may factor the trinomial in the following way. Factor \\(a=1\\): \\[1=1\\cdot 1.\\] Factor \\(c=8\\): \\[8=1\\cdot 8=2\\cdot 4.\\] Choose a proper combination of pairs of factors and check if the sum of cross product equals \\(b=6\\): \\[1\\cdot 4+ 1\\cdot 2=6.\\] This step can be checked easily using the following diagram. Factor the trinomial \\[x^2+6x+8=(x+2)(x+4).\\] :::` Factor \\(2x^2+5x-3\\). One may factor the trinomial in the following way. Factor \\(a=2\\): \\[1=1\\cdot 2.\\] Factor \\(c=-3\\): \\[-3=1\\cdot (-3)=(-1)\\cdot 3.\\] Choose a proper combination of pairs of factors and if the sum of cross products equals \\(b=5\\): \\[2\\cdot 3+1\\cdot(-1)=5.\\] This step can be checked easily using the following diagram. Factor the trinomial \\[2x^2+5x-3=(x+3)(2x-1).\\] Use Auxiliary Problem. Some higher degree polynomials may be rewrite as a trinomial after a substitution. Factoring the trinomial helps factor the polynomial. Factor the trinomial completely. \\[4x^4-x^2-3\\] One idea is to use a substitute. Let \\(x^2=y\\). Then \\(4x^4-x^2-3=4y^2-y-3\\). Factor the trinomial in \\(y\\): \\(4y^2-y-3=(4y+3)(y-1)\\). Replace \\(y\\) by \\(x^2\\) and factor further. \\[ \\begin{split} 4x^4-x^2-3&amp;=4y^2-y-3\\\\ &amp;=(4y+3)(y-1)\\\\ &amp;=(4x^2+3)(x^2-1)\\\\ &amp;=(4x^2+3)(x-1)(x+1). \\end{split} \\] 2.6 Practice Factor out the GCF. \\(18x^2y^2-12xy^3-6x^3y^4\\) \\(5x(x-7)+3y(x-7)\\) \\(-2a^2(x+y)+3a(x+y)\\) Factor by grouping. \\(12xy-10y+18x-15\\) \\(12ac-18bc-10ad+15bd\\) \\(5ax-4bx-5ay+4by\\) Factor completely. \\(25x^2-4\\) \\(8x^3-2x\\) \\(25xy^2+x\\) Factor completely. \\(3x^3+6x^2-12x-24\\) \\(x^4+3x^3-4x^2-12x\\) Factor the trinomial. \\(x^2+4x+3\\) \\(x^2+6x-7\\) \\(x^2-3x-10\\) Factor the trinomial. \\(5x^2+7x+2\\) \\(2x^2+5x-12\\) \\(3x^2-10x-8\\) Factor completely into polynomials with integer coefficients. \\(x^3-5x^2+6x\\) \\(4x^4-12x^2+5\\) \\(2x^3y-9x^2y^2-5xy^3\\) Each of trinomial below has a factor in the table.

Suppose that \\(Q\\) is not a constant function. The quotient \\(\\frac{P}{Q}\\) is called a rational expression, the polynomial \\(P\\) is called the numerator, and the polynomial \\(Q\\) is called the denominator.

Equivalent Reduction. What if all denominators are the same? How to make denominators the same? A general strategy to solve such a problem is to reduce the problem to an easier one using equivalent operations. Find the LCD of \\(\\dfrac{3}{x^2-x-6}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{6}{x^2-4}\\). Factor each denominator. \\[ x^2-x-6=(x+2)(x-3)\\qquad x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2) \\] List the factors of the first denominator and add unlisted factors of the second factor to get the final list.

A complex rational expression is equivalent to the quotient of its numerator by its denominator. That suggests the following strategy to simplify a complex rational expression. Simplify and Change the Viewpoint. A complex rational expression is a quotient of two rational expressions. You may rewrite it as an multiplication by flipping the denominator. However, its better to simply the numerator and denominator or you wont see a good looking new expression.

How long should the ladder be placed to reach the window? The hight of that window is 50 feet. 4.2 Radical Expressions If \\(b^2=a\\), then we say that \\(b\\) is a square root of \\(a\\). We denote the positive square root of \\(a\\) as \\(\\sqrt{a}\\), called the principal square root. For any real number \\(a\\), the expression \\(\\sqrt{a^2}\\) can be simplified as \\[ \\sqrt{a^2}=|a|. \\] If \\(b^3=a\\), then we say that \\(b\\) is a cube root of \\(a\\). The cube root of a real number \\(a\\) is denoted by \\(\\sqrt[3]{a}\\). For any real number \\(a\\), the expression \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^3}\\) can be simplified as \\[ \\sqrt[3]{a^3}=a. \\] In general, if \\(b^n=a\\), then we say that \\(b\\) is an \\(n\\)-th root of \\(a\\). If \\(n\\) is even, the positive \\(n\\)-th root of \\(a\\), called the principal \\(n\\)-th root, is denoted by \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\). If \\(n\\) is odd, the \\(n\\)-the root \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) of \\(a\\) has the same sign with \\(a\\). In \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\), the symbol \\(\\sqrt{\\phantom{a}}\\) is called the radical sign, \\(a\\) is called the radicand, and \\(n\\) is called the index. If \\(n\\) is even, then the \\(n\\)-th root of a negative number is not a real number. For any real number \\(a\\), the expression \\(\\sqrt[n]{a^n}\\) can be simplified as \\(\\sqrt[n]{a^n}=|a|\\) if \\(n\\) is even. \\(\\sqrt[n]{a^n}=a\\) if \\(n\\) is odd.

Rationalize the denominator. \\(\\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^3}}\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{y}}\\) In this case, to get rid of the radical in the bottom, we multiply the expression by \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}}\\) so that the radicand in the bottom becomes a perfect power. \\[ \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^3}}=\\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^3}}\\cdot\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}}{2\\sqrt{x^2}\\sqrt{x}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}}{2x^2}. \\] In this case, we use the formula \\((a-b)(a+b)=a^2+b^2\\).

Hence \\(\\ii^2=-1\\). If \\(b\\) is a positive number, then \\(\\sqrt{-b}=\\ii\\sqrt{b}\\). Let \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are two real numbers. We define a complex number by the expression \\(a+b \\ii\\). The number $a $ is called the real part and the number \\(b\\) is called the imaginary part. If \\(b=0\\), then the complex number \\(a+b\\ii=a\\) is just the real number. If \\(b\\neq 0\\), then we call the complex number \\(a+b\\ii\\) an imaginary number. If \\(a=0\\) and \\(b\\neq 0\\), then the complex number \\(a+b\\ii=b\\ii\\) is called a purely imaginary number. Adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing or simplifying complex numbers are similar to those for radical expressions. In particular, adding and subtracting become similar to combining like terms.

In total, 15 handshakes occurred. Do you know how many people in the group? 5.2 Properties of Equations An equation is an statement that asserts an equality containing unknown variables. For example, \\(2x+3=1\\) is an equation of the unknown variable \\(x\\). Equations often contain variables other than the unknowns. Those variables, which are assumed to be known, are usually called constants, coefficients or parameters. For example, in the linear equation \\(ax+b=c\\) of (the unknown) \\(x\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are referred as known coefficients or constants. An identity is an equation that is true for all possible values of the variable(s) it contains. For example, \\(x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)\\) is an identity. Solving an equation consists of determining values of the variables that make the equality true. Two equations are said to be equivalent if and only if they have the same solution set, that is, a solution of one equation is also a solution of the other equation. For example \\(2x-6=0\\) and \\(x-1=2\\) are equivalent. When solving an equation, the following operations can be used to transform an equation to an equivalent one: Adding or subtracting the same quantity to both sides of an equation. For example, \\(x-1=2\\) is equivalent to \\(x-1+1=2+1\\). Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by a non-zero quantity. For example \\(2x=4\\) is equivalent to \\(\\frac{2x}{2}=\\frac{4}{2}\\). Applying an identity to transform one side of the equation. For example, \\(x^2-1=0\\) is equivalent to \\((x-1)(x+1)=0\\), where the identity \\(x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)\\) was applied. In general, one may apply any choice of a function to both sides of the equation to make a transformation. The resulting equation still has the solutions of the original equations as it solutions. However, the resulting equation may also have some extra solutions which are called extraneous solutions. For example, taking squares of both sides of the equation \\(x=1\\) produces the equation \\(x^2=1\\). The new equation \\(x^2=1\\) has two solutions \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\), but the original equation \\(x=1\\) only has one solution. The solution \\(x=-1\\) of the equation \\(x^2=1\\) is an extraneous solution of the equation \\(x=1\\). 5.3 Quadratic Equations A polynomial equation is an equation that can be written in the form \\[ a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}=0, \\] where \\(n\\) is a positive integer and \\(a_n\\ne 0\\). A polynomial equation is called a quadratic equation if \\(n=2\\). For example, \\(2x^2+5x-3=0\\). We often write a quadratic equation in its standard form \\[a x^2+bx+c=0,\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are numbers, and \\(a\\neq 0\\). When solving linear equations, arithmetic operations are enough. In general, one may need to use identity or functional operation. Factoring is one of those frequently used identity operation. Indeed, to solve a problem, a general strategy is to to reduce the original problem to easier problems. Using factoring and the zero product property: \\[A\\cdot B=0 \\quad ~~\\text{if and only if}~~ \\quad A=0 ~~\\text{or}~~ B=0,\\] one can transform a polynomial equation into smaller degree polynomial equations. In particular, if \\(ax^2+bx+c=(mx-p)(nx-q)\\), then a solution of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\) is a solution of either \\(mx-p=0\\) or \\(nx-q=0\\).

Translate given information into expressions in \\(x\\) and build an equation. Total Width: \\(2x+10\\)  Total Length: \\(2x+16\\) Width \\(\\times\\) Length=Total Area: \\[(2x+10)(2x+16)=216.\\] Solve the equation. \\[ \\begin{aligned} (2x+10)(2x+16)&amp;=216\\\\ 4x^2+52x+160&amp;=216\\\\ 4x^2+52x-56&amp;=0\\\\ x^2+13x-14&amp;=0\\\\ (x+14)(x-1)&amp;=0 \\end{aligned} \\] \\[ x = -14\\quad \\text{or}\\quad x = 1 \\] So the width of the path is \\(1\\) meter.

One way to solve rational equations is to clear all denominators by multiplying the LCD to both sides. Note that because there are values such that the LCD has the value zero. Clearing denominator in general is not an equivalent transformation, rather a functional transformation. So dont forget to check possible extraneous solutions. Solve \\[ \\dfrac{5}{x^2-9}=\\dfrac{3}{x-3}-\\dfrac{2}{x+3}. \\] Find the LCD. Since \\(x^2-9=(x+3)(x-3)\\), the LCD is \\((x+3)(x-3)\\). Clear denominators.

If it is zero, then the solution is extraneous. \\[ (-10+3)(-10-3)\\neq 0 \\] So \\(x=-10\\) is a valid solution of the original equation. Reduction With Auxiliary Conditions Clearing denominator uses the strategy reduction with auxiliary conditions. The auxiliary condition used when clearing the denominators is that the LCD is non-zero. Generally, if you dont know how to solve a problem under the given condition, you may try solve the problem by adding extra conditions first and then try to eliminate the extra conditions and/or their consequences. 7.3 Literal Equations A literal equation is an equation involving two or more variables.

Solve by Reduction The goal to solve a single variable equation is to isolate the variable. When an equation involves radical expressions, you can not isolate the variable arithmetically without eliminating the radical sign unless the radicand is a perfect power.

The following properties show when the inequality relationship is preserved or reversed. Property Example The additive property If \\(a&lt;b\\), then \\(a+c&lt;b+c\\), for any real number \\(c\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\), then \\(a-c&lt;b-c\\), for any real number \\(c\\). If \\(x+3&lt;5\\), then \\(x+3-3&lt;5-3\\). Simplifying both sides, we get \\(x&lt;2\\). The positive multiplication property If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c\\) is positive, then \\(ac&lt;bc\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c\\) is positive, then \\(\\frac ac&lt;\\frac bc\\). If \\(2x&lt;4\\), then \\(\\frac{2x}{2}&lt;\\frac{4}{2}\\). Simplifying both sides, we get \\(x&lt;2\\). The negative multiplication property If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c\\) is negative, then \\(ac&gt;bc\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c\\) is negative, then \\(\\frac ac&gt;\\frac bc\\). If \\(1&lt;2\\), then \\(-2=1\\cdot(-2)&gt;2\\cdot(-2)=-4\\). If \\(-2x&lt;4\\), then \\(\\frac{-2x}{-2}&gt;\\frac{4}{-2}\\). Simplifying both sides, we get \\(x&gt;2\\). These properties also apply to \\(a\\leq b\\), \\(a&gt;b\\) and \\(a\\geq b\\). Its always better to view \\(a-c\\) as \\(a+(-c)\\). Because addition has the commutative property. Compound Inequalities A compound inequality is formed by two inequalities with the word and or the word or. For examples, the following are three commonly seen type compound inequalities: \\[ x-1&gt;2\\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2x+1&lt;3, \\] \\[ 3x-5&lt;4\\quad \\text{or} \\quad 3x-2&gt;10, \\] \\[ -3\\leq \\frac{2x-4}{3}&lt;2. \\] The third compound inequality is simplified expression for the compound inequality \\(-3\\leq \\frac{2x-4}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{2x-4}{3}&lt;2\\). Interval Notations Solutions to an inequality normally form an interval which has boundaries and should reflect inequality signs. Depending on the form of an inequality, we may a single interval and a union of intervals. For example, suppose \\(a&lt;b\\), we have the following equivalent representations of inequalities. 10.3 Examples Think backward. To solve a problem, knowing what to expect helps you narrow down the gap step by step by comparing the goal and your achievement. An inequality (equation) is solved if the unknown variable is isolated. Thats what to be expected. To isolate the unknown variable, you use comparisons to determine what mathematical operations should be applied. When an operation is applied to one side, the same operation should also be applied to the other side. For inequalities, we also need to determine whether the inequality sign should be preserved or reversed according to the operation.

Can you describe this relation? Can you draw conclusions based on the graph? Can you estimate how many people in total had positive tests on 2020/01/01? What do think the trending will be after 2020/1/27? Why? 11.2 Definition and Notations A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The set of all first components of the ordered pairs is called the domain. The set of all second components of the ordered pairs is called the range. A function is a relation such that each element in the domain corresponds to exactly one element in the range. For a function, we usually use the variable \\(x\\) to represent an element from the domain and call it the independent variable. The variable \\(y\\) is used to represent the value corresponding to \\(x\\) and is called the dependent variable. We say \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\). When we consider several functions together, to distinguish them we named functions by a letter such as \\(f\\), \\(g\\), or \\(F\\). The notation \\(f(x)\\), read as \\(f\\) of \\(x\\) or \\(f\\) at \\(x\\), represents the output of the function \\(f\\) when the input is \\(x\\). The domain of a function is the set of all allowed inputs. The range of a function is the set of all outputs. To find the value of a function define by an equation at a given number, we substitute the independent variable \\(x\\) by the given number and then evaluate the expression. We call the procedure evaluating a function. Find the indicated function value. \\(f(-2)\\), \\(f(x)=2x+1\\) \\(g(2)\\), \\(g(x)=3x^2-10\\) \\(h(a-t)\\), \\(h(x)=3x+5\\). \\(f(-2)=2\\cdot(-2)+1=-4+1=-3\\). \\(g(-2)=3\\cdot(2^2)-10=3\\cdot 4-10=12-10=2\\). \\(h(a-t)=3\\cdot(a-t)+5=3a-3t+5\\). 11.3 Graphs of Functions The graph of a function is the graph of its ordered pairs. A graph of ordered pairs \\((x,y)\\) in the rectangular coordinate system defines \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\) if any vertical line crosses the graph at most once. This test is called the vertical line test. Determine which of the following graphs defines a function. Because in graphs A. B. C. there are vertical lines intersecting the graph at two points. So those graphs fail the vertical line test and hence dont define functions. In graph D., although the graphs are not connected, but any vertical line only intersects one point. Therefore, Graph D. defines a functions. 11.4 Graph Reading The domain of a graph is the set of \\(x\\)-coordinates of all points on the graph. The range of a graph is the set of \\(y\\)-coordinates of all points on the graph. To find the domain of a graph, we look for the left and the right endpoints. To find the range of a graph, we look for the highest and the lowest positioned points. To find the coordinates of a point on a graph, one draw a horizontal line and a vertical line through the point. The number on the \\(x\\)-axis where the vertical line passing through is the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point. The number on the \\(y\\)-axis where the horizontal line passing through is the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the point. Use the graph in the picture to answer the following questions. Determine whether the graph is a function and explain your answer. Find the domain (in interval notation) of the graph. Find the range (in interval notation) of the graph. Find the interval where the graph is above \\(2\\). Find the interval where the graph is is decreasing. Find all maximum and minimum values of the function if they exist. Find the value of \\(y\\) such that the point \\((3, y)\\) is on the graph. Find the value of \\(x\\) such that \\((x, 0)\\) is on the graph. The graph is a function. Because every vertical line crosses the graph at most once. The graph has the left endpoint at \\((-2, -2)\\) and but no right endpoint. So the domain is \\([-2, +\\infty)\\). The graph has a lowest positioned point \\((-2, -2)\\) but no highest positioned point. So the range is \\([-2, +\\infty)\\). The graph is above 2 over the interval \\((3, \\infty)\\). The graph is decreasing over the interval \\((1,2)\\). The graph has minima at \\((-2,1)\\) and \\((2,1)\\). The \\(y\\)-value of the point \\((3, y)\\) on the graph is \\(2\\). The \\(x\\)-value of the point \\((x, 0)\\) on the graph is \\(-0.5\\). 11.5 Practice Find the indicated function values for the functions \\(f(x)=-x^2+x-1\\) and \\(g(x)=2x-1\\).

The sale price for each unit is $25. What is total cost, total revenue and total profit at varying levels of output? 12.2 The Slope-Intercept Form Equation The slope of a line measures the steepness, in other words, rise over run, or rate of change of the line. Using the rectangular coordinate system, the slope \\(m\\) of a line is defined as \\[ m=\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\dfrac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}=\\dfrac{\\text{change in the output }y}{\\text{change in the input } x}, \\] where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are any two distinct points on the line. If the line intersects the \\(y\\)-axis at the point \\((0, b)\\), then a point \\((x, y)\\) is on the line if and only if \\[ y=mx+b. \\] This equation is called the slope-intercept form of the line. 12.3 Point-Slope Form Equation of a Line Suppose a line passing through the point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) has the slope \\(m\\). Solving from the slope formula, we see that any point \\((x, y)\\) on the line satisfies the equation equation \\[ y=m(x-x_0)+y_0 \\] which is called the point-slope form equation. 12.4 Linear Function A linear function \\(f\\) is a function whose graph is a line. An equation for \\(f\\) can be written as \\[f(x) = mx + b\\] where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b=f(0)\\). A function \\(f\\) is a linear function if the following equalities hold \\[ \\dfrac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1} =\\dfrac{f(x_3)-f(x_1)}{x_3-x_1} \\] for any three distinct points \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\) and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) on the graph of \\(f\\). 12.5 Equations of Linear Functions Find the slope-intercept form equation for the linear function \\(f\\) such that \\(f(2)=5\\) and \\(f(-1) = 2\\). Find the slope \\(m\\): \\(m=\\frac{f(2)-f(-1)}{2-(-1)}=\\frac{5-2}{2-(-1)}=\\frac{3}{3}=1\\). Plug one of the points, say \\((2, 5)\\) in the point-slope form equation, we get \\(y=1\\cdot(x-2)+5\\) Simplify the above equation, we get the slope-intercept form equation \\(f(x)=x+3\\). 12.6 Graph a Linear Function by Plotting Points Sketch the graph of the linear function \\(f(x)=-\\frac12 x + 1\\). Method 1: Get points by evaluating \\(f(x)\\). Choose two or more input values, e.g. \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\). Evaluate \\(f(x)\\): \\(f(0)=1\\) and \\(f(2)=0\\). Plot the points \\((0, 1)\\) and \\((2, 0)\\) and draw a line through them. Method 2: Get points by raise and run. Plot the \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0, f(0))=(0, 1)\\). Use \\(\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\) to get one or more points, e.g, we will get \\((-2, 2)\\) by taking \\(\\text{rise}=1\\) and \\(\\text{run}=-2\\), i.e. move up \\(1\\) unit, then move to the right \\(2\\) units. Plot the points \\((0, 1)\\) and \\((-2, 2)\\) and draw a line through them. 12.7 Horizontal and Vertical Lines A horizontal line is defined by an equation \\(y=b\\). The slope of a horizontal line is simply zero. A vertical line is defined by an equation \\(x=a\\). The slope of a vertical line is undefined. A vertical line gives an example that a graph is not a function of \\(x\\). Indeed, the vertical line test fails for a vertical line. 12.8 Explicit Function When studying functions, we prefer a clearly expressed function rule. For example, in \\(f(x)=-\\frac23x+1\\), the expression \\(-\\frac23x+1\\) clearly tells us how to produce outputs. For a function \\(f\\) defined by an equation, for instance, \\(2x+3y=3\\), to find the function rule (that is an expression), we simply solve the given equation for \\(y\\). \\[ \\begin{aligned} 2x+3y&amp;=3\\\\ 3y&amp;=-2x+3\\\\ y&amp;=-\\frac23x+1. \\end{aligned} \\] Now, we get \\(f(x)=-\\frac23x+1\\). 12.9 Perpendicular and Parallel Lines Any two vertical lines are parallel. Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. A line that is parallel to the line \\(y=mx+a\\) has an equation \\(y=mx+b\\), where \\(a\\neq b\\). Horizontal lines are perpendicular to vertical lines. Two non-vertical lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\). A line that is perpendicular to the line \\(y=mx+a\\) has an equation \\(y=-\\frac1m x+b\\). 12.10 Finding Equations for Perpendicular or Parallel Lines Find an equation of the line that is parallel to the line \\(4x+2y=1\\) and passes through the point \\((-3, 1)\\).

By Newtons Law of Cooling, after \\(t\\) minutes, the temperature of the object \\(T(t)\\) is given by the exponential function \\[ T(t)=T_{\\text{env}}+(T(0)-T_{\\text{env}})\\,e^{-rt}, \\] where \\(r\\) is a positive constant characteristic of the system. A cup of coffee is brewed with a temperature 195°F and placed in a room with the temperature 60°F. The cooling constant for a cup of coffee is $ r = .09 ^{-1}$. After 30 minutes, what is the temperature of the coffee? How long it takes for the coffee to cool down to the room temperature? 18.2 Exponential and Logarithmic Equations To solve an exponential or logarithmic equation, the first step is to rewrite the equation with a single exponentiation or logarithm. Then we can use the equivalent relation between exponentiation and logarithm to rewrite the equation and solve the resulting equation. Solve the equation \\(10^{2x-1}-5=0\\). Rewrite the equation in the form \\(b^u=c\\): \\[10^{2x-1}=5.\\] Take logarithm of both sides and simplify: \\[2x-1=\\log 5.\\] Solve the resulting equation: \\[x=\\frac{1}{2}(\\log5+1).\\] Solve the equation \\(\\log_2 x + \\log_2 (x - 2) = 3\\). Rewrite the equation in the form \\(\\log_bu=c\\): \\[\\log_2(x(x - 2)) = 3\\] Rewrite the equation in the exponential form (moving the base): \\[x(x-2)=2^3\\] Solve the resulting equation \\(x^2-2x-8=0\\). The solutions are \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=4\\) Check proposed solutions. Both \\(x\\) and \\(x-2\\) has to be positive. So \\(x=-2\\) is not a solution of the original equation. When \\(x=4\\), we have \\(\\log_24+\\log_22=2+1=3\\). So \\(x=4\\) is a solution. 18.3 Solving Compound Interest Model A check of $5000 was deposited in a savings account with an annual interest rate \\(6\\%\\) which is compounded monthly. How many years will it take for the money to raise by 20%? The question tells us the following information: \\(P=5000\\), \\(r=0.06\\), \\(n=12\\), and \\(A=5000\\cdot (1+0.2)=6000\\). What we want to know is the number of years \\(t\\). The compound interest model tells us that \\(t\\) satisfies the following equation: \\[ 6000=5000\\left(1+\\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12t}. \\] This is an exponential equation and can be solve using logarithms. \\[ \\begin{aligned} 5000\\left(1+\\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12t}&amp;=6000\\\\ \\left(1+\\frac{0.06}{12}\\right)^{12t}&amp;=1.2\\\\ 12t\\cdot \\log\\left(1+0.06\\div 12\\right)&amp;=1.2\\\\ 12t&amp;=\\log(1.2)\\div \\log(1+0.06\\div 12)\\\\ t&amp;=\\log(1.2)\\div\\log(1+0.06\\div 12)\\div 12\\approx 3. \\end{aligned} \\] So it takes about 3 years for the savings to raise by 20%. When solving exponential and logarithmic equations, you may also use the one-to-one property if both sides are powers with the same base or logarithms with the same base. 18.4 Practice Solve the exponential equation. \\(2^{x-1}=4\\) \\(7e^{2x}-5=58\\) Solve the exponential equation. \\(3^{x^2-2x}=e^{-\\ln3}\\) \\(2^{(x+1)}=3^{(1-x)}\\) Solve the logarithmic equation. \\(\\log_5x+\\log_5(4x-1)=1\\) \\(\\ln \\sqrt{x+1}=1\\) Solve the logarithmic equation. \\(\\log_2(x+2)-\\log_2(x-5)=3\\) \\(\\log_3(x-5)=2-\\log_3(x+3)\\) For the given function, find values of \\(x\\) satisfying the given equation. \\(f(x)=\\log_4x-2\\log_4(x+1)\\),\\(f(x)=-1\\) \\(g(x)=\\log(2-5x)+\\log(-x)\\),\\(g(x)=1\\) Find intersections of the given pairs of curves. \\(f(x)=e^{2x}\\) and~ \\(g(x)=e^x+12\\). \\(f(x)=\\log_7\\left(\\frac12(x+2)\\right)\\) and~ \\(g(x)=1-\\log_7(x-3)\\) Using the formula \\(A=P(1+\\frac rn)^{nt}\\) to determine how many years, to the nearest hundredth, it will take to double an investment $20,000 at the interest rate 5% compounded monthly. Newtons Law of Cooling states that the temperature \\(T\\) of an object at any time \\(t\\) satisfying the equation \\(T=T_s+(T_0-T_s)e^{-rt}\\), where \\(T_s\\) is the the temperature of the surrounding environment, \\(T_0\\) is the initial temperature of the object, and \\(r\\) is positive constant characteristic of the system, which is in units of \\({\\displaystyle \\text{time}^{-1}}\\). In a room with a temperature of \\(22 ^\\circ C\\), a cup of tea of \\(97 ^\\circ C\\) was freshly brewed. Suppose that \\(r=\\ln 5/20~~\\text{minute}^{-1}\\). In how many minutes, the temperature of the tea will be \\(37 ^\\circ C\\)? A culture of bacteria began with 1000 bacteria and grows exponentially. An hour later there were 1320 bacteria. How many hours after starting will there be 2790 bacteria? A type of virus started spreading. After 10 days, 580 infected cases was confirmed. The natural log of the number of confirmed cases approximately is a linear function of the number of days after the virus started spreading. The slope of this linear function is 0.28. Suppose the pattern continues. Estimate the number of infected cases after 20 days.
