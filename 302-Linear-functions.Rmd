# Linear Functions

## The Slope-Intercept Form Equation

The slope of a line measures the steepness, in other words, "rise" over "run", or rate of change of the line. Using the rectangular coordinate  system, the ***slope*** $m$ of a line is defined as
$$
m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\dfrac{\text{change in the output }y}{\text{change in the input } x},
$$
where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are any two distinct points on the line. If the line intersects the $y$-axis at the point $(0, b)$, then a point $(x, y)$ is on the line if and only if
$$
y=mx+b.
$$
This equation is called the ***slope-intercept form*** of the line.

## Point-Slope Form Equation of a Line

Suppose a line passing through the point $(x_0, y_0)$ has the slope $m$. Solving from the slope formula, we see that any point $(x, y)$ on the line satisfies the equation equation
$$
y=m(x-x_0)+y_0
$$
which is called the ***point-slope form*** equation.

## Linear Function

A ***linear function*** $f$ is a function whose graph is a line. An equation for $f$ can be written as
$$f(x) = mx + b$$
where $m$ is the slope and $b=f(0)$.

A function $f$ is a linear function if the following equalities hold
$$
\dfrac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}
=\dfrac{f(x_3)-f(x_1)}{x_3-x_1}
$$
for any three distinct points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$ on the graph of $f$.

## Equations of Linear Functions

```{example}

Find the slope-intercept form equation for the linear function $f$ such that $f(2)=5$ and $f(-1) = 2$.

```

```{solution}
\


1. Find the slope $m$: $m=\frac{f(2)-f(-1)}{2-(-1)}=\frac{5-2}{2-(-1)}=\frac{3}{3}=1$.
2. Plug one of the points, say $(2, 5)$ in the point-slope form equation, we get $y=1\cdot(x-2)+5$
3. Simplify the above equation, we get the slope-intercept form equation $f(x)=x+3$.

```

## Graph a Linear Function by Plotting Points

```{example}

Sketch the graph of the linear function $f(x)=-\frac12 x + 1$.

```

```{solution}
\

**Method 1: Get points by evaluating $f(x)$.**

1. Choose two or more input values, e.g. $x=0$ and $x=2$.
2. Evaluate $f(x)$: $f(0)=1$ and $f(2)=0$.
3. Plot the points $(0, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$ and draw a line through them.

**Method 2: Get points by raise and run.**

1. Plot the $y$-intercept $(0, f(0))=(0, 1)$.
2. Use $\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=-\frac{1}{2}$ to get one or more points, e.g, we will get $(-2, 2)$ by taking $\text{rise}=1$ and $\text{run}=-2$, i.e. move up $1$ unit, then move to the right $2$ units.
3. Plot the points $(0, 1)$ and $(-2, 2)$ and draw a line through them.

## Horizontal and Vertical Lines

A ***horizontal line*** is defined by an equation $y=b$. The slope of a horizontal line is simply zero.
A ***vertical line*** is defined by an equation $x=a$. The slope of a vertical line is **undefined**.

A vertical line gives an example that a graph is not a function of $x$. Indeed,
the vertical line test fails for a vertical line.

## Explicit Function

When studying functions, we prefer a clearly expressed function rule. For example, in $f(x)=-\frac23x+1$, the expression $-\frac23x+1$ clearly tells us how to produce outputs.  For a function $f$ defined by an equation, for instance, $2x+3y=3$, to find the function rule (that is an expression), we simply solve the given equation for $y$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
2x+3y&=3\\
3y&=-2x+3\\
y&=-\frac23x+1.
\end{aligned}
$$
Now, we get $f(x)=-\frac23x+1$.

## Perpendicular and Parallel Lines

Any two vertical lines are parallel. Two non-vertical lines are ***parallel*** if and only if they **have the same slope**.

A line that is parallel to the line $y=mx+a$ has an equation $y=mx+b$, where $a\neq b$.

Horizontal lines are perpendicular to vertical lines. Two non-vertical lines are ***perpendicular*** if and only if **the product of their slopes is $-1$**.

A line that is perpendicular to the line $y=mx+a$ has an equation $y=-\frac1m x+b$.

## Finding Equations for Perpendicular or Parallel Lines

```{example}

Find an equation of the line that is parallel to the line $4x+2y=1$ and passes through the point $(-3, 1)$.

```

```{solution}
\

1. Find the slope $m$ of the original line from the slope-intercept form equation by solving for $y$.  $y=-2x+\frac12$. So $m=-2$.
1. Find the slope $m_\parll$ of the parallel line.
    $$m_\parll=m=-2.$$
1. Use the point-slope form.
    $$
        \begin{aligned}
            y-1&=-2(x+3)\\
            y&=-2x-5.
        \end{aligned}
    $$

```

```{example}

Find an equation of the line that is perpendicular to the line $4x-2y=1$ and passes through the point $(-2,3)$.

```

```{solution}
\

1. Find the slope $m$ of the original line from the slope-intercept form equation by solving for $y$.  $y=2x-\frac12$. So $m=2$.
1. Find the slope $m_\perp$ of the perpendicular line.
    $$m_\perp=-\frac1m=-\frac12.$$
1. Use the point-slope form.
    $$
        \begin{aligned}
            y-3&=-\frac12(x+2)\\
            y&=-\frac{1}{2}x+2.
        \end{aligned}
    $$
