## Half-life

::: {.rmdthink}

Half-life is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half of its initial value.

A certain pesticide is used against insects. The half-life of the pesticide is about 12 days. After a month how much would left if the initial amount of the pesticide is 10 g? Can you write a function for the remaining quantity of the pesticide after $t$ days?

## Definition and Graphs of Exponential Functions

Let $b$ be a positive number other than $1$ (i.e. $b>0$ and $b\neq 1$). The exponential function $f$ of $x$ with the base $b$ is defined as
$$
f(x)=b^x\quad\quad\text{or}\quad\quad y=b^x.
$$

The exponential function $f(x)=b^x$ is a one-to-one function: any vertical line or any horizontal line crosses the graph at most once. Equivalently, the equation $b^x=c$ has at most one solution for any real number $c$.

## The Natural Number $e$

The natural number $e$ is the number to which the quantity  $\left(1+\dfrac1n\right)^n$ approaches as $n$ takes on increasingly large values. Approximately,  $e\approx2.718281827$.

## Compound Interests

After $t$ years, the balance $A$ in an account with a principal $P$ and annual interest rate $r$ is given by the following formulas:

1. For $n$ compounding periods per year: $A=P\left(1+\dfrac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$.
1. For compounding continuously: $A=Pe^{rt}$.

:::{example}

A sum of $\$10,000$ is invested at an annual rate of $8\%$, Find the balance, to the nearest hundredth dollar,  in the account after $5$ years if the interest is compounded

1. monthly,
1. quarterly,
1. semiannually,
1. continuous.

1. Find values of $P$, $r$, $t$ and $n$. In this case, $P=10,000$, $r=8\%=0.08$, $t=5$ and $n$ depends compounding.
1. Plug the values in the formula and calculate.
1. ``Monthly'' means $n=12$. Then
    $$
    A=10000\left(1+\frac{0.08}{12}\right)^{5\cdot 12}\approx 14898.46.
    $$
1. ``Quarterly'' means $n=4$. Then
    $$
    A=10000\left(1+\frac{0.08}{4}\right)^{5\cdot 4}\approx 14859.47.
    $$
1. ``semiannually'' means $n=2$. Then
    $$
    A=10000\left(1+\frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{5\cdot 2}\approx 14802.44.
    $$
1. For continuously compounded interest, we have
    $$
    A=10000e^{0.08\cdot 5}\approx 14918.25.
    $$

In the compounded investment module, the $\frac rn$ is an approximation of the period interest rate. Indeed, if the period rate $p$ satisfies the equation $(1+p)^n=1+r$, or equivalently $p=\sqrt[n]{1+r} - 1$. Using the formula $(1+x)^n=1+nx+\frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^2+\cdots +x^n$, one may approximately replace $1+r$ by $(1+\frac rn)$ and obtain the approximation $p\approx \frac rn$.

:::{example}

The population of a country was about 0.78 billion in the year 2015, with an annual growth rate of about 0.4\%.
The predicted population is $P(t)=0.78(1.004)^t$ billions after $t$ years since 2015.
To the nearest thousandth of a billion, what will the predicted population of the country be in 2030?

:::

:::{solution}
\

The population is approximately
$$
P(15)=0.78(1.004)^{15}\approx 0.828 \quad \text{billions}.

The value of a car is depreciating according to the formula: $V=25000(3.2)^{-0.05x}$,
where $x$ is the age of the car in years.
Find the value of the car, to the nearest dollar, when it is five years old.
